While not rate limited by the API a user is limited in the number of Tweets they can create at a time.

About Geo Any geo-tagging parameters in the update will be ignored if geo_enabled for the user is false (this is the default setting for all users unless the user has enabled geolocation in their settings) The number of digits passed the decimal separator passed to lat , up to 8, will be tracked so that the lat is returned in a status object it will have the same number of digits after the decimal separator. Please make sure to use to use a decimal point as the separator (and not the decimal comma) for the latitude and the longitude - usage of the decimal comma will cause the geo-tagged portion of the status update to be dropped. For JSON, the response mostly uses conventions described in GeoJSON . Unfortunately, the geo object has coordinates that Twitter renderers are reversed from the GeoJSON specification (GeoJSON specifies a longitude then a latitude, whereas we are currently representing it as a latitude then a longitude. Our JSON renders as: \"geo\": { \"type\":\"Point\", \"coordinates\":[37.78217, -122.40062] } The coordinates object is replacing the geo object (no deprecation date has been set for the geo object yet) \u2014 the difference is that the coordinates object, in JSON, is now rendered correctly in GeoJSON. If a place_id is passed into the status update, then that place will be attached to the status. If no place_id was explicitly provided, but latitude and longitude are, we attempt to implicitly provide a place by calling geo/reverse_geocode . Users will have the ability, from their settings page, to remove all the geotags from all their tweets en masse.

Follow the Uploading media guide guide to upload one or more media entities, and then use POST statuses/update to attach them to a Tweet. Updates the authenticating user's current status and attaches media for upload. In other words, it creates a Tweet with a picture attached. Unlike POST statuses/update , this method expects raw multipart data. Your POST request's Content-Type should be set to multipart/form-data with the media[] parameter. The Tweet text will be rewritten to include the media URL(s), which will reduce the number of characters allowed in the Tweet text. If the URL(s) cannot be appended without text truncation, the tweet will be rejected and this method will return an HTTP 403 error. Users are limited to a specific daily media upload limit. Requests to this endpoint will return the following headers with information regarding the user's current media upload limits: X-MediaRateLimit-Limit - Indicates the total pieces of media the current user may upload before the time indicated in X-MediaRateLimit-Reset . X-MediaRateLimit-Remaining - The remaining pieces of media the current user may upload before the time indicated in X-MediaRateLimit-Reset . X-MediaRateLimit-Reset - A UTC-based timestamp (in seconds) indicating when X-MediaRateLimit-Remaining will reset to the value in X-MediaRateLimit-Limit and the user can resume uploading media. If the user is over the daily media limit, this method will return an HTTP 403 error. In addition to media upload limits, the user is still limited in the number of statuses they can publish daily. If the user tries to exceed the number of updates allowed, this method will also return an HTTP 403 error, similar to POST statuses/update . OAuth is handled differently for POST messages. See Uploading Media for more details on this.
